## Process

* I took considerable amount of time to understand the scale the project and work out the best suited tools for the task. This led me to write the code exercise initially on vanilla JavaScript with Flickity plugin.

* I was able to quickly get the sliders displayed on the page, however I had to style it to my requirements. Once I was able to get the slider looking presentable, I started looking into re-creating the project in React. I researched into using Flickity with React and downloaded it via NPM. One of the challenge was to figure out how to work with its react component as it didn't provide react docs/support.

* With a lot of iterations, I was able to get the slider displayed. From here on, I styled the slider, which was also the most enjoyable part of this project.

* My MVP for this exercise was to be able to display a working slider that is fully responsive and be creative with the styling.
